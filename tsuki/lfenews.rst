After several months of sporadic Discord activity, Tsuki makes the following statement about the status of the TSUKI Project over the past several months:

"Unexpected difficulties on the Representative's side and internal drama have caused a temporary long-term outage on the Life frontend of the TSUKI Project. Please rest assured that the issue has been resolved and this frontend will be back in full operation."


In July 2017, due to a misunderstanding between the Tsuki Representative and a personal associate known as MrSnoopDoge (as well as a loss of energy and spirit on behalf of the Representative himself), the official discord and the systemspace.link website were taken offline. The associate then released confidential Project information, mistakenly believing the TSUKI Project to be concluded. After a period of roughly 5 months, the associate then created the new Official Discord and invited the Representative, who has decided to continue Project operations. The TSUKI Project is now resuming. Migrants affected by the data breach can apply for new EIDs, once the new systemspace.link website is live.

but stopped in time by the TSUKI/Synapse forces. A full scan of the Mountain is under way.

An entire block of eNdymioN staff were thrown out of the TSUKI project and replaced.
Migrants are celebrating.

2017-05-22
----------

RISEN demands that a website allowing migrants to open their gates after July 1st but before the unlink is made. They say that migrants will still be able to transfer if they don't open their gates, but having a gate open would make them easier to track. They want to make the gate timed, so a user would only be able to open it for 48 hours.

No further details are provided but speculation and distrust for RISEN are growing.

A RISEN employee shows up in a near-death state. A TSUKI rescue team managed to get to the location in time and stabilize him. Preliminary reports indicate the RISEN employee was choked, but no suspects were identified or apprehended.

There are no signs that would identify the perpetrator as a Hyakanghen; the victim has not been shattered.

There is speculation that this was a warning from the terrorist group, but it is unconfirmed as of yet.

----------

Hyakanghen group Kanyra agrees to cease interference in the TSUKI project.

Kanyra is one of the less influential Hyakanghen groups  in the outskirts of LFE, situated mainly around western-Euclean universes. Nevertheless, this marks a major change in tone of Hyakanghen dialogue with the TSUKI members.

Kanyra members made comments expressing their positive attitude towards humans. The cause of their actions is as of yet unknown. 

In other news, eNdymioN shares are down 1.43%. RISEN is down 0.07%. Synapse has, against all odds, gone up by 0.12%.

2017-04-27
----------

Multiple eNdymioN employees are being charged with exposing unknown, highly confidential data. Nobody can provide evidence, though.

Tensions and heavy speculation concerning the void stream are rising in LFE.

**BREAKING - Over 120 important eNdymioN members on strike**

Apparently some eNdymioN members are protesting against the Life > LFE transfer.

Synapsian representatives are disturbed by the radio silence on eNdymioN's side.

Second hand reports claim that eNdymioN employees associated with TSUKI are missing, and the group on strike is not connected to the TSUKI project.

The void stream has changed, implying someone at eNdymioN is fiddling with it.

2017-04-24
----------

eNdymioN provides Tsuki with a stream to put up on the TSUKI project website. They are saying it contains human-readable data.

Tsuki loses contact with eNdymioN.

----------

The crisis is in full swing.

Tsuki mentions Hayra (a RISENII) is angered by the situation.

----------

Tsuki mentions there is an epidemic in one universe caused by all the matter holding a specific type of energy that is toxic to all living species in there.
