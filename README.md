This github is a mixture of:
- an archive of all tweets and writings that i've collected
- code i've used to archive their feediverse tweets
- selected screenshots that i've collected, there are actually many more not here in the sources stated below
- anything else i could find

## Deleted pages
If you try to track down stuff here, its likely that you'll find that accounts and pages referenced have been deleted (since after publishing this github they know exactly where i got my data from). I've actually run across this multiple times, where i was researching a webpage and I would come back one hour later and it would be gone.

I've tried to archive every website I've found through https://archive.ph/, so if you run across deleted data, try inputting the link on archive.ph to see if there is any snapshot.

Overall, a big part of the trail that kaliacc left has been lost to internet rot and active deletion, since all their twitter accounts are deleted, the discord servers they used are long gone and they used to be active in multiple imageboards that no longer exist, so trying to find stuff on them is quite hard. I've done my best to document everything I could here to avoid more losses.

If you run into any page that is not archived, use https://archive.ph/ to create a snapshot.

## Repo structure
The folders are pretty self explanatory, but here's the rundown:
- bpd_god: an archive of all the tweets and likes from bpd_god account on twitter
- group-chat: an archive of recent screenshots that got leaked from remilia's group chat
- miya-social: multiple json archives of tweets from miya's accounts on multiple fediverse servers, along with the code i used to extract them
- most-extreme: just a compilation of some of the most extreme stuff
- writings: a compilation of all of miya's writings on her blog
- selected-ig-screenshots/selected-tweets: just some selected screenshots, best way to find everything here is to go to the primary source

## Remilia

All of remilia is connected:
- A lot of members followed anorexic girls and miya-related accounts
- charlotte openly talked about kaliacc and being sonya in the remilia group chat
- for the two members that are supposed to lead milady after charlotted stepped down:
  - sonora appears on the archive of kaliacc website
  - yojimbo appears in a lain and aryan-themed website along with 'miya = "CharlotteReed77"', which was actually created by someone from kaliacc that built the real time chat for remilia's site

## Proof

### bpd_god is miya
- account name of bpd_god was literally miya
- miya tweeted from their account on https://letsalllovela.in/users/miya that their handle on twitter was @bpd_god
- not spending much time here because any digging into miya reveals bpd_god as the main account, it's everywhere

### Sonya proof:
- GC message talking about tweeting as sonya
- seems like it was actually same account as bpd_god and handle just got changed
- podcast linking sonya and bpd_god: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kali-yuga-accelerationism-and-the-metaphysics/id1464427103?i=1000501926421

- https://warosu.org/lit/thread/15691893#p15692268
- account that documented all the stuff on ig also links them together

### Grooming
- main source: https://www.instagram.com/hellokittyrazorb1adee/
- tweets from https://twitter.com/DegenSmegma
- remilia group chat leak: https://twitter.com/cuteness333/status/1527636588527702017

### Proof of writings
- You can see all the miya writings here: https://dk1lib.org/s/miya?e=1&yearFrom=2018&yearTo=2020 (usa1lib.org)
- Miya's neocities page: https://web.archive.org/web/20210209082457/https://miya-miya.neocities.org/thoughts/
    - especially: https://web.archive.org/web/20200212113601/https://miya-miya.neocities.org/black_heart/
    - miya refers to this neocities page in multiple of her tweets (example: "from my blog [link to neocities page]" on blog.png)

### Proof of remilia implication:
- https://github.com/yuminaut/soma.cx/blob/master/jade.js
- archive of kaliacc.org has a mention of sonora 
- almost all remilia members followed kaliacc-related accounts on twitter

### Systemspace proof
Found multiple independent sources of this:
- someone very close to miya confirmed it through cuteness
- an anon (different one) that had A LOT of info from miya/kaliacc from years ago and claimed to be ex-kaliacc confirmed it too
- it was mentioned in a forum a year ago: https://social.xenofem.me/notice/A4ksXFPT6DkJg1fKIC
- in multiple posts across image boards people claim that kaliacc and systemspace were connected
- multiple people have come out saying that they were pushed to suicide by kaliacc and miya
- it aligns quite well with everything else from miya
    - miya tweets saying he ran a suicide cult and advocating for suicide
    - posts on letsalllovelain (suicide related)
    - soma.cx (lain and nazi website) has a miya=charlotte reference from 1 year ago

Proof that someone killed themselves due to systemspace:
- News on the death of 17yo teen Jake Fehr: https://globalnews.ca/news/3670986/missing-teen-found-dead-in-west-kelowna/
- Archive of radio show on his death: https://archive.ph/DeaG5
- Wiki linking them together: https://en.everybodywiki.com/TSUKI_Project
